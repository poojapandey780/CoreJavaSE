map(function<R>) -> one to one
flatMap(function Stream<R>) -> one to many
MapToInt() ->Converts elements to int (primitive). -allow methods -max(),min(),average(),sum().
MapToDouble() ->Converts elements to double (primitive). -allow methods



collectors -> that provides reduction operations
 (like collecting results into a List, Set, Map, or a joined String, etc.).


 Collectors.joining() â€“ Join Strings -It combines all stream elements into a single String.


 filter() removes elements that don't match a given predicate (boolean condition).


 Combine filter() + joining()  -eg. Join only names that start with A
